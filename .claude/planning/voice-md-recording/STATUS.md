## Progress
- [ ] Research | [x] Planning | [ ] Implementation | [ ] Review | [ ] Deploy

## Phase: Planning âœ“
- **Phases:** 4 phases, Est: 5hr
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Key Decisions:**
  - Use OpenAI Whisper API (requires API key configuration)
  - Desktop-only plugin due to MediaRecorder browser API reliability
  - Layered architecture with separate audio/API/command modules
- **Next:** `/execute-plan`

## Artifacts
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- PROJECT_SPEC.md

## Notes
- Starting from Obsidian sample plugin template
- Will need to add `openai` npm package as dependency
- Browser MediaStream API requires HTTPS or localhost (Obsidian provides this)
- Audio data is ephemeral (not persisted locally for privacy)
