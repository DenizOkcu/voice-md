# Status: Voice MD Plugin

**Risk:** Low | **Updated:** 2025-10-19

## Progress
- [x] Research | [ ] Planning | [ ] Implementation | [ ] Review | [ ] Deploy

## Phase: Research ✓

**Key Findings:**
- Clean slate implementation with no technical debt or conflicts
- All required browser APIs (MediaRecorder, AudioContext, fetch) available in Obsidian runtime
- Build system and TypeScript configuration ready for modular development

**Recommendations:**
- Follow modular architecture with separate files (settings, recorder, transcriber, utils)
- Use existing Obsidian patterns for settings persistence and command registration
- Add API key security disclosure in settings UI

**Next:** `/issue-planner` to create detailed implementation plan and project specification

## Artifacts
- `.claude/planning/voice-md-plugin/CODE_RESEARCH.md` - Comprehensive codebase research
- `.claude/planning/voice-md-plugin/STATUS.md` - This file

## Critical Decisions
1. Mobile support: ✅ Supported via feature detection for mime types
2. Max recording duration: Recommend 10-minute limit for memory safety
3. API key security: Must disclose unencrypted storage in settings UI
4. Error handling: Single attempt with clear user-facing error messages

## Open Questions for Planning
1. Single toggle command vs. two separate start/stop commands?
2. Recording state persistence across restarts? (Recommend: No)
3. Timestamp format for insertion? (ISO 8601 vs. locale format)
